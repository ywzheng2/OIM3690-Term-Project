    <h1>Project Proposal for OIM3690-02 Web Tech</h1>
    <hr />
    <h3>What is your website about?</h3>
    <p>My website is about at-home workouts.</p>
    <h3>
      What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site
      be important?)
    </h3>
    <p>
      My website will include a series of at-home workout plans and at-home
      workout videos from different sources such as YouTube. Workout helps
      people improve their quality of sleep and performance and reduces stress.
      However, it is difficult for many employees to find time to exercise and
      stay healthy. In particular, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, companies have
      invested in advanced technologies that support and enhance working from
      home experience. Also, many large corporations are offering different ways
      of working. These changes have blurred the boundary between professional
      and personal life. At-home fitness routines are the best solution because
      they are extremely effective, flexible, and feasible.
    </p>
    <h3>Who is your target audience?</h3>
    <p>
      My target audience is young employees who work primarily virtually or
      spend most of their time working from home and hoping to have a healthy
      lifestyle.
    </p>
    <h3>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h3>
    <p>
      The first page will include at-home workout plans, where the viewer can
      choose a plan that fits them. The second page will be about upper-body
      workout videos, and the third page will include lower-body workout videos.
      I plan to have at-home workout tips and a workout/wellness tracker on the
      fourth and fifth pages.
